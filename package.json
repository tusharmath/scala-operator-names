  "description": "This is a list of **cute** operator names that I have generally seen in scala code-bases. One letter operators such as `!` (excalmation) or `*` (star) are easy to communicate verbally. But when it comes to multicharacter operators, dictating each letter one by one turns out to be quite inefficient. (Infact I have often used _hand gestures_ üññü§èü§ô to describe the operator I would want to use).",
