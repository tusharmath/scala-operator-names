# scala-operator-names 😅

This is a list of **cute** operator names that I have generally seen in scala code-bases.
One letter operators such as `!` (excalmation) or `*` (star) are easy to communicate verbally.
But when it comes to multicharacter operators, dictating each letter one by one turns out to be quite inefficient.
(Infact I have often used _hand gestures_ 🖖🤏🤙 to describe the operator I would want to use).

So finally I decided to have a list of **cute** names which are easier to remember for most commonly used scala operators —

| **Operator** | **Common Name** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| `*>`         | Ice Cream       |
| `<*`         | Reverse Cream   |
| `<>`         | Diamond         |
| `++`         | Fence           |
| `+++`        | Wide Fence      |
| `>=>`        | Fish            |
| `=>`         | Fat Arrow       |
| `->`         | Thin Arrow      |
| `~>`         | Squiggly Arrow  |
| `>>`         | Forward         |
| `<<`         | Back            |
| `>>>`        | Fast Forward    |
| `<<<`        | Rewind          |
| `::`         | Cube            |
| `:::`        | Cuboid          |

If you think you have a better name or if you want to add another operator please send a PR 🙌

# Guidelines

1. Ensure the names are cute 🐥
2. Should not leak implementation details 🙅

That's all 🙏

Give it a ⭐ if you like it!
