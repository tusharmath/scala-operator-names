# scala-operator-names 😅

This is a list of **cute** operator names that I have generally seen in scala code-bases. 
One letter operators such as `!` (excalmation) or `*` (star) are easy to communicate verbally. 
But when it comes to multicharacter operators, dictating each letter one by one turns out to be quite inefficient.
(Infact I have often used _hand gestures_ 🖖🤏🤙 to describe the operator I would want to use).

So finally I decided to have a list of **cute** names which are easier to remember for most commonly used scala operators —

| **Operator** | **Common Name** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| `*>`         | Ice Cream       |
| `<*`         | Reverse Cream   |
| `<>`         | Diamond         |
| `++`         | Fence           |
| `+++`        | Wide Fence      |
| `>=>`        | Fish            |

PS: PRs are welcome!
